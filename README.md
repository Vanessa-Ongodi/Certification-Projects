### Why Data Storytelling?
Data storytelling is the practice of building a narrative around a set of data and its accompanying visualizations to help convey the meaning of that data in a powerful and
compelling fashion. Data storytellers describe the material in the same way as a story does, having a beginning, middle, and end. They also provide worldly emotions like as empathy to help listeners readily grasp the topic. <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/take-a-career-twist-top-data-storyteller-jobs-to-apply-today/#:~:text=Similar%20to%20a%20tale%2C%20data,for%20top%20data%20storyteller%20jobs.">Companies</a> all around the world are hiring great data storytellers as data storytelling has become more popular. 

* In this folder, you will find projects I took to kickstart my data storytelling journey. They include graded assignments, capstone projects and case studiess
The CSV files of the datasets and jupyter notebooks containing the analyzed datasets with each step of the data interpretation have been well documented for each folder.

The image above shows the steps I took to begin my data storytelling journey:
* Open sources materials: To get started in my journey as a data storyteller, I sourced free open-source materials where I can learn the basics of the programming software - Python which will be useful for data visualization.
Before this, I had a knowledge of R programming so I focused on getting open-source materials for Python fundamentals.
<a href="http://freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp </a> was the best website that provided free open-source materials and I learned the basics of Python with their Data Analysis with Python course.

* Paid courses for certification: To be seen as a certified data analyst and/or data storyteller, I needed to not just rely on free open-source materials and the best way to show
commitment to this journey was to pay for a course online that will challenge my knowledge and I get certified in the end. I enrolled for the Google Analytics Course on Coursera and at the end of the eight-course syllabus, I earned my certificate 
with an intermediate knowledge on how to clean data, analyze data and present data findings with visuals.

* Internship: apart from practising with open-source materials and getting certified, I also need real-world knowledge on how I can develop myself as a data storyteller. I applied for the 
Hamoye Data Science Winter 2022 cohort and I was accepted. This internship is stipulated for January to April 2022 and I am currently in Stage B of the Data storytelling track. 

* Career as a Data storyteller: at the end of the internship, I hope to take the skills I have learned, and apply for a role as a data storyteller.
