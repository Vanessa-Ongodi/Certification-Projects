## Data Analysis with Python

![Freecodecamp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96535282/152957427-d0bb485e-ed31-4203-bc68-c44b6fc03038.png)

The data analysis with python certification in freecodecamp introduced me to how I can use python for my data analysis. I learned how to work with code and the python libraries required for data analysis and visualization. These libraries are:

* Numpy: used for array manipulation and numeric computing
* Matplotlib: most popular python library in the python ecosystem. It is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* Requests: pull data from the web
* Pandas: process data
* Bokeh: generates interactive plots that can be manipulated within your browser
* Seaborn: data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

I also worked on data cleaning and handling missing data in a dataframe.
