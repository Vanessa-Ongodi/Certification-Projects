## Hamoye Data Science Internship

I was fortunate to be selected as part of the HDSC Winter 2022 cohort which will help me in my path to becoming a Data storyteller. Hamoye Ltd. is an ed-tech startup and as stated in the Hamoye Winter 2022 handbook:

*Our mission is to help prepare young professionals and college interns for their chosen
careers and the future of work. It is a known fact that getting the first professional job,
post-college education is universally challenging. Depending on the country, it may be
the most difficult challenges young graduates will ever face. Whether one is successful at
it or not could determine the course of one’s life. This is where Hamoye comes in. We
offer world-class, specially designed, internship style learning programs, to help
prospective interns acquire real-world work experience. All for free. What’s the catch?
There is no catch! Our goal is to help struggling young professionals or college
students who want to set themselves up for success with some of the tools they need to
differentiate themselves in the tough tech job market.
Our internship programs simulate the real work environment while cutting out all of the
unnecessary distractions that come with traditional internships. Not only do we have the
capacity to provide everyone with an opportunity to acquire job-ready expertise, we
have the special sauce to ensure our interns get the best out of the experience. Also,
interns will work alone and with peers, in a fast-paced, competitive environment, to keep
them motivated throughout their choice program.
Our internship programs are offered 3 to 4 times a year and involve:
(i) specially designed short courses with real-world projects to introduce interns to the
tools they need to stand out
(ii) exposure to industry experts via webinars
(iii) career coaching and
(iv) presentation project with peers.
Our Social Learning Management Platform (hamoye.com) is designed to help interns
participate from anywhere in the world, track their accomplishments, and showcase
themselves to potential employers.*

This Data Science internship is divided into three tracks:

* Data Science
* MLOps/Data Engineering
* Data Storytelling


I chose the Data storytelling track and the curriculum is divided into five stages: 


* Stage A: Introduction to Python for Machine Learning 
* Stage B: Becoming a Data Storyteller
* Stage C: Python Libraries for Data Storytelling
* Stage D: Data Storytelling in Pattern Recognition
* Stage E: Data Curation for Storytelling and a capstone project.

I will upload the tag-along projects, assignments, and capstone projects to this folder as I proceed.
